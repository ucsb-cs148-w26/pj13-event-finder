Testing libraries Used:
React Testing Library

We installed the react testing library and used the App.test.js file that was autogenerated when we created the webapp with react to create and run tests. We ran two unit tests. First a simple one just to ensure functionality of the testing library, where we checked if the "Event Finder" test was rendered. Next we created and ran a unit test to see if the city state dropdown was working. Both tests passed, ensuring that the testing library was properly installed and working as well as giving us full confidence that our city state dropdown function was working. The App.test.js file is in event-finder/frontend/src/App.test.js
