When a team member is absent, the member will let everyone know in BOTH the edstem and the team discord.

If possible, a team member should try to join via discord if they are unable to attend class.

Any github merging issues should be brought up so they don't get out of hand.

When a team member knows they will be absent ahead of time, they need to let the team know so we can plan accordingly.

If a team member feels they have too much work to do, they need to speak up so we can accomplish tasks more efficiently.
