## MVP Feedback Review

Our feedback is largely clustered into the following groups:

1. Adding a distance radius from the user inputted location (since LA is a large city, simply filtering by city may not be feasible). Adding distance filtering to go along with this.
2. Add more APIs, including smaller ones that users can upload their own, smaller-scale events to.
3. A recommendation system that allows events to be more personalized to the user's interests.
4. Integrating the site into things such as notifications, calendar or schedule.

### Next Steps

We already have plans to address the distance and map components, allowing us to implement exact location and distance calculations and therefore distance filtering. We also have plans to integrate the EventBrite and Reddit APIs, and are currently searching for other APIs to integrate alongside our LLM. We are also working on state saving, using Firebase and Google Authentication, allowing the LLM to take more information from the user profile.
