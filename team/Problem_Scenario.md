John is a freshmen who just started his first year at UCSB. He wants to reach out to other students and find events where he can connect to other peers. He's been using Instagram and Shoreline, but Shoreline has lots of messy filters and doesn't include a lot of ongoing events and searching through UCSB Instagram accounts is very time consuming. He is looking for something he can use to quickly locate events going on near him. This is when he discovers our event finder app. After using this app for a while he has a great time navigating the user friendly UI and realizes the simple yet effective nature of the app. With this app he can now easily locate events near him with minimal effort. This lets him quickly discover events near him that he can happily attend without the fuss of scrolling through hundreds of instagram accounts or missing out on events that are not on Shoreline.
