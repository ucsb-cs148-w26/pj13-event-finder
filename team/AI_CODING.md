The tool I used was ChatGPT in the browser, without any VSCode extensions. I used it to help with my task of authentication, integrating Firebase and Google OAuth into a login page with the option to continue as guest. ChatGPT was very helpful in generating me code files and telling me where to go in the Firebase developer console and how to structure my authentication files in my repo. I plan to also use it to create both a frontend component that will hook into the authentication and user databases for state saving. To ensure correctness, I took the setup files from ChatGPT and read through them, doing manual debugging and further prompting the AI to explain code sections when necessary.

The tool I used was Google Gemini 3 and cursor IDE agent. I used Gemini to help generate a UI revamp prompt for cursor to make our frontend design more sleek and appealing towards users, as well as having it review cursor's changes. I used cursor IDE to direcly change the code live, which was helpful is letting me review and approve of changes as the agent went through the process of generating code. Cursor was able to quickly generate a revamp, but there were many small errors that I had to manually fix. However it is definitely faster to have cursor generate the revamp and make small tweaks myself rather than manually revamping the entire UI myself. I plan on using Gemini to help give me potential pointers and answer questions I may have about the webapp development and using cursor to quickly generate code for strenuous tasks that would otherwise take a lot of time.
