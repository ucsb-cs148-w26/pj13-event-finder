## Scribed Discussion

### Team:
We came together on a discord call to create the MVP demo video. We ran into some troubles with deployment with the frontend since the new city state UI system couldn't properly connect to the API and also since CORS was denying our access to the backend through a link since it thought it was getting hacked. We troubleshooted and fixed these issues and were able to successfully deploy our webapp and create the MVP video that we will present. Since Wendy is absent she will record her part seperately and it will be attached to the video that we made later.
