## Scribed Discussion

### Team:
We discussed how to split up issues and finished 4 basic User Stories and assigned sub-issues to all of them. We discussed what APIs we will use and assigned sub-issues to each team member present. We chose to put off work on Firebase database for now since we currently do not need it for the functionality of our website. We started and finished a basic frame for the frontend of our website and started work on setting up the TicketMaster API. Next step is finishing setting up all the APIs we want to use and polishing the website.
